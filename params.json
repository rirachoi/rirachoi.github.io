Here you will find :\r\n\r\n  - Projects and source code\r\n  - Homework assignments and code\r\n  - My personal best in # of commits\r\n  - Hidden easter eggs and gems\r\n\r\nCheck out my latest project, fresh off the Sublime press ;)\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd ~/\r\n$ mkdir riras_news\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/rirachoi/world_map_news.git riras_news/\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Who Am I?\r\nFull-Stack Web Developer with a track record in all things Ruby and experience in Graphic Design and Illustration. Ambitious focus on all things Ruby on Rails, Javascript, jQuery, Front-end design and web technologies. Seeking a role as a full-stack web developer. I also make a mean cup of coffee ;)\r\n\r\n### Rather Drive Stick?\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nAll code here is free like beer should be. Shoutout goes to Larlyn Tanasap(@lyntco) and Rich Field (@toodelirious) for the great team effort put into our Team Project (https://github.com/lyntco/fireball).\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\n![LinkedIn](http://i.imgur.com/qWAb9QI.png)\r\n![Twitter](http://i.imgur.com/3m1iZSP.png)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
